# jquery.Roadblocked

A jQuery plugin to rapidly implement device-targeted, landing interstitials for mobile + tablet visitors to your site. Basically, with just a few configurations, you can surface full-screen media to specific devices (say iPad) before showing standard page content. Interstitials can be configured to run once per X period for special promotions/campaigns. 

Please see demo page for implementation details.
